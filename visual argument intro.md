	My visual argument project is called “the face of beauty” and it’s a collage of things that are not conventionally beautiful. I used images of crooked teeth, acne, stomach rolls, face wrinkles, crossed eyes, and a model in a wheelchair. I wanted my project to make the audience question their beauty standards and help them find beauty in things we, as a society, tend to cast off for not fitting conventional beauty standards.
